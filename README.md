# Digital Signal Processing

## Lab work 1
Create all primitive signal and sound them using Visual Studio and C#
1. Sine
2. Triangle
3. Square
4. Sawtooth
5. Implusle with different duty cycle

## Lab work 2
Determine the period of the signal by taking count of points and calculate signal haracteristics.

## Lab work 3
Decompose the signal into Fourier series. Show the Amplitude and Phase spectrums of the signal. Create Low Frequency and High Frequency Filters.

Create a smoothing to the signal to remove the noises and other not necessary elements from the signal.
Methods:
1. Average arithmetic window.
2. Parabola in 4 degree.
3. Median Filtering window.

## Image Filtering
Filtering the image with 2D Median filtering windows to remove noises and other not necessary elements from the image.
